# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the impact the silver tsunami will have to staffing needs at Pewlett-Hackard. The silver tsunami being an upcoming wave of employees, born from years 1952 to 1955, with upcoming eligibility for retirement. Additionally, we also must understand how many employees will remain with the company to offer mentorship to the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees, and if we have enough mentors on staff to make the transition successful.

## Results

* Retirment Title - Details all employees with upcoming retirement dates who are still with the company and their current titles.
* List consolidating employee count per title of all positions up for retirement. This allows us to see how many at each position will need to be backfilled during the silver tsunami.
    * Senior Engineer - 25916	positions to open
    * Senior Staff - 24926	positions to open
    * Engineer - 9285	positions to open
    * Staff - 7636	positions to open
    * Technique Leader - 3603	positions to open
    * Assistant Engineer - 1090	positions to open
    * Manager - 2	positions to open



## Summary

When the silver tsunami is complete, we can anticipate that a total of 72,458 positions will need to be filled once complete. To plan for the first year the silver tsunami rolls out, I pulled information on all current employees born in 1952 as they will be the first to be elligble for retirement. Within the first year of the silver tsunami, the following position counts will need to be filled:
    * Senior Engineer - 6743	positions to open
    * Senior Staff - 6332	positions to open
    * Engineer - 2377	positions to open
    * Staff - 1901	positions to open
    * Technique Leader - 895	positions to open
    * Assistant Engineer - 288	positions to open
    * Manager - 1	position to open

It will be a difficult task to train for all positions opening in the first wave of the silver tsunami. Pewlett-Hackard has 1464 employees who can serve as mentors to take on mentoring the next generation of PH employees. They are broken out into position as follows:
    * Senior Engineer - 155 mentors available
    * Senior Staff - 543 mentors available
    * Engineer - 466 mentors available
    * Staff - 151 mentors available
    * Technique Leader - 72 mentors available
    * Assistant Engineer - 77 mentors available
    * Manager - 0 mentors available
    
 There are far less mentors available than positions to be trained for. The ratio of mentor to trainee are as follows:
    * Senior Engineer - 1:44
    * Senior Staff - 1:12
    * Engineer - 1:6
    * Staff - 1:13
    * Technique Leader - 1:13
    * Assistant Engineer - 1:4
    * Manager - 0 mentors available
    
 As indicated above, this presents the greated risk for training for the role of Senior Engineer as the ratio of mentor to trainees is 1 to 44. A good way to resolve this may be to review current promotable employees working as Engineers, and jumping in to train and promote them before the silver tsunami starts to spread the training over a longer period of time.
 
 It should also be noted that even though there are zero Manager mentores, we may be able to find mentors in those who served this role in the past and were promoted. Additionally since there are few Manager positions to fill, it may be easier to find new candidates with a previous history in management to take on these roles.
